- Identify top-performing products.
- Evaluate regional sales performance.
- Present findings using structured SQL queries and data exports.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Query Language**: SQL (Joins, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, CTEs)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Dataset
The dataset includes sales transactions with fields such as:
- `Sale_ID` (Unique identifier)
- `Date` (Transaction date)
- `Product` (Item sold)
- `Category` (Product category)
- `Region` (Sales region)
- `Quantity` (Units sold)
- `Price` (Unit price)

A retail business lacked insight into its sales trends, making it difficult to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

### **Approach**
1. Collected raw sales data from the database.
2. Cleaned and validated data to remove inconsistencies.
3. Performed SQL queries to extract revenue and product performance.
4. Generated reports to present the findings.

### **Outcome**
- Clear understanding of high-performing products.
- Better regional sales distribution analysis.
- Data-driven decision-making for sales strategies.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze business sales data effectively. The insights gained can help companies optimize their sales strategy, improve regional distribution, and enhance profitability.
